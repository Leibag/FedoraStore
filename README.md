# <h1>FedoraStore</h1>
<h6>The Fedora Store is a minimalist program store that aims to help me learn about python scripts.</h6>

FedoraStore uses two python libraries, OS and prettytable.
In order for the script to run, you need to install the prettytable library, command for installation below.

<p>sudo pip install prettytable<p>
<p>sudo pip install pyfiglet<p>
